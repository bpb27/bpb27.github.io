Use Slack for group communication. You can message any member of coalition, or the whole group. You can form sub-groups, like midwife nurses in Leribe, or pharmacists, etc. Share resources and ideas, ask questions, stay in touch. Works on laptop and mobile phone. Saves chat history, and you can go back and search through it.

Create a Facebook for social media presence. You can run advertisements that will target health care professionals in Lesotho and South Africa so they will see the coalition. Facebook campaigns to engage the public, rally behind poor health situation and need for drastic improvement.

Email relevant health organizations and NGOs in the area to get them on board.

Advocacy - old fashioned calling offices. If each member calls, it will build up pressure, considering how few health workers there are in country. Potential for private (or public) contacting congress like tool. Also hit their social media. Use coalition status to arrange meeting with the MOH.

Questions:
  Do most health care professionals have smartphones? Laptops? Reliable internet access?
  Are there other social media networks other than Facebook used in Lesotho?
  What needs do health care workers have that could be aided by technology?
  Donations?
